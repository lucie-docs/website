    <h1>WHO WE ARE.</h1>
    <p>Opt Out is non-profit organisation, founded in 2019. We are an <strong>international collective</strong> of savvy tech professionals,
      data analysts, gender theorists, activists and academics. Together we are creating tools to help ourselves and our
      sisters to <strong>opt out from online misogyny</strong>. We want women to be able to use the internet to
      its full potential, as a space where they can join in political debate <strong>without fear of being silenced.</strong></p>
